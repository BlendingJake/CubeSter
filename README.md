CubeSter is an add-on for Blender 3D that takes an image and converts it into
a height-bases mesh object composed of cubes. The cubes height is bases upon
the pixel intensity and alpha value at that point. 

CubeSter can cause Blender to go unresponsive for a period of time, so an
approximate time to generate the mesh is listed in the panel.
